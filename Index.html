<p style="text-align:justify">The effect of social media on the development of students’ affective variables
<p style="text-align:justify">The use of social media is incomparably on the rise among students, influenced 
by the globalized forms of communication and the post-pandemic rush to use multiple social media platforms for 
education in different fields of study. 
<br><br>
<br>
<em><p>Here is the Introduction of the Topic</em></p>
<ol>
<b><li><p><b> Introduction</b></li></b>
<img src="C:\Users\fujitsuSH75t\Desktop\final output\2.jpg" width="250" height="150">
<p style="text-align: justify"> Social media has turned into an essential element of individuals’ lives 
including students.
<b><u><font>today’s world of communication. Its use is growing significantly more than ever before 
especially in the post-pandemic era</u> </font> Recent investigations of using social media show that 
approximately 3 billion individuals worldwide are now communicating via social media (Iwamoto and Chun, 2020).
This growing population of social media users is spending more and more time on social network groupings, 
as facts and figures show that individuals spend 2 h a day, on average, on a variety of social media applications, 
exchanging pictures and messages, updating status, tweeting, favoring, and commenting on many updated socially shared 
information (Abbott, 2017).

<p style="text-align: justify">Researchers have begun to investigate the psychological effects of using social media
 on students’ lives. Chukwuere and Chukwuere (2017) maintained that social media platforms can be considered the most 
 important source of changing individuals’ mood, because when someone is passively using a social media platform seemingly 
 with no special purpose, s/he can finally feel that his/her mood has changed as a function of the nature of content overviewed. 
 Therefore, positive and negative moods can easily be transferred among the population using social media networks (Chukwuere and Chukwuere, 2017). 
 This may become increasingly important as students are seen to be using social media platforms more than before and social networking is becoming an 
 integral aspect of their lives. As described by Iwamoto and Chun (2020), when students are affected by social media posts, especially due to the increasing 
 reliance on social media use in life, they may be encouraged to begin comparing themselves to others or develop great unrealistic 
 expectations of themselves or others, which can have several affective consequences.

<br>
<br>
<b><li><b>Significance of the study</b></li></b>
<img src=" C:\Users\fujitsuSH75t\Desktop\final output\3.jpg" width="250" height="150">
<p style="text-align: justify">Though social media, as the name suggests, is expected to keep people connected, probably this social connection
 is only superficial, and not adequately deep and meaningful to help individuals feel emotionally attached to others. The psychological effects 
 of social media on student life need to be studied in more depth to see whether social media really acts as a social support for students and 
 whether students can use social media to cope with negative emotions and develop positive feelings or not. In other words, knowledge of the potential 
 effects of the growing use of social media on students’ emotional well-being can bridge the gap between the alleged promises of social media and what it
 actually has to offer to students in terms of self-concept, self-respect, social role, and coping strategies (for stress, anxiety, etc.).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Before getting down to the effects of social media on students’ emotional well-being, some exemplary works of research
in recent years on the topic among general populations are reviewed. For one, Aalbers et al. (2018) reported that individuals who spent more time passively 
working with social media suffered from more intense levels of hopelessness, loneliness, depression, and perceived inferiority.
 For another, Tang et al. (2013) observed that the procedures of sharing information, commenting, showing likes and dislikes, posting messages, and
 doing other common activities on social media are correlated with higher stress. Similarly, Ley et al. 
 (2014) described that people who spend 2 h, on average, on social media applications will face many tragic news, posts, and
 stories which can raise the total intensity of their stress. This stress-provoking effect of social media has been also pinpointed by Weng and
 Menczer (2015), who contended that social media becomes a main source of stress because people often share all kinds of posts, comments, and 
 stories ranging from politics and economics, to personal and social affairs. According to Iwamoto and Chun (2020), anxiety and depression are
 the negative emotions that an individual may develop when some source of stress is present. 
 In other words, when social media sources become stress-inducing, there are high chances that anxiety and depression also develop.

<b><li><p><b> Review of the affective influences of social media on students</b></li></b>
<img src="C:\Users\fujitsuSH75t\Desktop\final output\4.jpg" width="250" height="150">
<p style="text-align: justify">Vygotsky’s mediational theory (see Fernyhough, 2008) can be regarded as a main theoretical background 
for the support of social media on learners’ affective states. Based on this theory, social media can play the role of a mediational means between learners and
 the real environment. Learners’ understanding of this environment can be mediated by the image shaped via social media.
 This image can be either close to or different from the reality. In the case of the former, learners can develop their self-image and self-esteem.
 In the case of the latter, learners might develop unrealistic expectations of themselves by comparing themselves to others.
 As it will be reviewed below among the affective variables increased or decreased in students under the influence of the massive use of social media 
 are anxiety, stress, depression, distress, rumination, and self-esteem. These effects have been explored more among school students in the age range of 13–18 than 
 university students (above 18), but some studies were investigated among college students as well. 
 Exemplary works of research on these affective variables are reviewed here.
</p>
<br>
<b><li><p><b>Discussion</b></li></b>
<img src="C:\Users\fujitsuSH75t\Desktop\final output\5.jpg" width="250" height="150">
<p style="text-align: justify">The body of research on the effect of social media on students’ affective and emotional states has led to mixed results.
 The existing literature shows that there are some positive and some negative affective impacts. Yet, it seems that the latter is pre-dominant.
 Mathewson (2020) attributed these divergent positive and negative effects to the different theoretical frameworks adopted in different studies and
 also the different contexts (different countries with whole different educational systems). According to Fredrickson’s broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions
 (Fredrickson, 2001), the mental repertoires of learners can be built and broadened by how they feel.
 For instance, some external stimuli might provoke negative emotions such as anxiety and depression in learners. 
 Having experienced these negative emotions, students might repeatedly check their messages on social media or get addicted to them. 
 As a result, their cognitive repertoire and mental capacity might become limited and they might lose their concentration during their learning process. 
 On the other hand, it should be noted that by feeling positive, learners might take full advantage of the affordances of the social media and; 
 thus, be able to follow their learning goals strategically. This point should be highlighted that the link between the use of social media and 
 affective states is bi-directional. Therefore, strategic use of social media or its addictive use by students can direct them toward either positive experiences
 like enjoyment or negative ones such as anxiety and depression. Also, these mixed positive and negative effects are similar to the findings of several other 
 relevant studies on general populations’ psychological and emotional health. A number of studies (with general research populations not necessarily students)
 showed that social networks have facilitated the way of staying in touch with family and friends living far away as well as an increased social support (Zhang, 2017).
 Given the positive and negative emotional effects of social media, social media can either scaffold the emotional repertoire of students, which can develop positive
 emotions in learners, or induce negative provokers in them, based on which learners might feel negative emotions such as anxiety and depression.
 However, admittedly, social media has also generated a domain that encourages the act of comparing lives, and striving for approval; therefore, it establishes and 
 internalizes unrealistic perceptions (Virden et al., 2014; Radovic et al., 2017).
